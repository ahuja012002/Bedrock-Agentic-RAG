- Electrical: Open and lock main disconnect
- Pneumatic: Shut off and bleed air lines
- Hydraulic: Shut off pumps and relieve pressure
- Mechanical: Block or secure moving parts
4. Apply lockout devices to all energy isolation points
5. Apply personal danger tags to each lockout device
6. Verify isolation by attempting to start equipment
7. Test for stored energy (capacitors, springs, pressure)
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
