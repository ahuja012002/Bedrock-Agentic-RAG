TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - CB-500 CONVEYOR BELT SYSTEM
Document Version: 2.1
Last Updated: December 2023
COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS
ISSUE 1: UNUSUAL NOISE FROM CONVEYOR
Symptoms: Grinding, squealing, or clicking sounds during operation
Possible Causes and Solutions:
A. Belt Misalignment
- Check belt tracking across entire length
- Adjust tracking rollers according to manual section 4.2
- Verify pulley alignment using laser alignment tool
- Solution: Realign belt and adjust tensioning system
B. Worn Bearings
- Listen for grinding noise from drive and tail pulleys
- Check for excessive play in roller bearings
- Monitor bearing temperature (should not exceed 160°F)
- Solution: Replace worn bearings, lubricate per schedule
C. Loose Fasteners
- Inspect all bolts and mounting hardware
- Check motor mounting bolts for tightness
- Verify structural frame connections
- Solution: Torque all fasteners to specification
D. Foreign Object in System
- Stop conveyor immediately if metallic clicking heard
- Inspect belt surface and pulleys for debris
- Check under-belt area for accumulated material
- Solution: Remove debris, install better screening upstream
ISSUE 2: BELT SLIPPING
Symptoms: Reduced conveyor speed under load, visible belt movement on pulleys
Possible Causes and Solutions:
A. Insufficient Belt Tension
- Measure belt sag at center span (should be 1-2 inches)
- Check tension using belt tension gauge if available
- Solution: Adjust take-up mechanism per manual section 3.4
B. Worn Pulley Lagging
- Inspect drive pulley surface for wear or damage
- Look for glazed or smooth areas on lagging
- Solution: Replace pulley lagging or resurface pulley
C. Contaminated Belt Surface
- Check for oil, grease, or other lubricants on belt
- Inspect for material buildup on belt surface
- Solution: Clean belt with approved cleaners, eliminate contamination source
ISSUE 3: MOTOR OVERHEATING
Symptoms: Motor running hot, thermal overload tripping
Possible Causes and Solutions:
A. Overloading
- Verify actual load does not exceed rated capacity (5000 lbs max)
- Check for material accumulation causing drag
- Monitor amp draw on motor starter
- Solution: Reduce load or upgrade to higher capacity system
B. Poor Ventilation
- Ensure motor cooling fan is operating
- Check for blocked air vents
- Verify ambient temperature is within limits (104°F max)
- Solution: Improve ventilation, clean motor exterior
C. Voltage Issues
- Measure voltage at motor terminals
- Check for voltage imbalance between phases
- Verify proper motor starter settings
- Solution: Correct electrical supply issues
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST
DAILY
□ Visual inspection for damage or wear
□ Check for unusual noise or vibration
□ Verify emergency stops are functional
□ Clean belt surface of debris
WEEKLY
□ Check belt tension and tracking
□ Lubricate bearings per lubrication chart
□ Inspect safety guards and covers
□ Check motor amp draw
MONTHLY
□ Detailed inspection of all rollers
□ Check pulley alignment
□ Inspect belt for cuts, tears, or wear
□ Test all electrical connections
QUARTERLY
□ Complete bearing inspection and relubrication
□ Check structural frame for cracks
□ Calibrate speed control system
□ Review maintenance logs and trends
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
1. If unusual noise occurs: Stop conveyor immediately
2. If smoke or burning smell detected: Shut down power and call emergency service
3. If personnel injury occurs: Follow site emergency procedures
4. If material spill occurs: Stop system and contain spill per material safety guidelines
