HYDRAULIC SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING
ISSUE 1: CYLINDER DRIFT (Ram Dropping Under Load)
Symptoms: Press ram slowly descends when holding pressure
Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check system pressure gauge reading
2. Observe rate of pressure drop
3. Test with different load weights
4. Check for external leakage
Possible Causes:
A. Internal Cylinder Leakage
Testing: Perform cylinder leak test per procedure HP-TEST-001
- Pressurize cylinder to 90% of maximum pressure
- Monitor pressure drop over 10 minutes
- Acceptable: <2% pressure drop
- Solution: Replace cylinder seals or cylinder assembly
B. Main Valve Internal Leakage
Testing: Isolate main valve and test
- Close manual isolation valve downstream
- Monitor pressure holding capability
- Solution: Rebuild or replace main control valve
C. Accumulator Failure
Testing: Check accumulator pre-charge pressure
- Should be 90% of minimum system pressure
- Test with nitrogen pressure gauge
- Solution: Recharge accumulator or replace bladder/diaphragm
ISSUE 2: SLOW OPERATION OR REDUCED FORCE
Symptoms: Press operates slowly or cannot achieve full tonnage
Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check hydraulic pump pressure output
2. Monitor flow rate at various pressures
3. Check hydraulic fluid temperature
4. Inspect filtration system
Possible Causes:
A. Hydraulic Pump Wear
Testing: Measure pump efficiency
- Monitor pressure vs. flow curve
- Check for excessive case drain flow
- Normal case drain: <10% of main flow
- Solution: Rebuild or replace hydraulic pump
B. Contaminated Hydraulic Fluid
Testing: Fluid analysis per ASTM D6224
- Particle count should be ISO 18/16/13 or better
- Water content <0.1%
- Acid number <0.5 mg KOH/g
- Solution: Change fluid and filters, investigate contamination source
C. Clogged Filters
Testing: Check pressure drop across filters
- Return filter: <25 PSI drop at rated flow
- Suction strainer: <5 PSI drop
- Solution: Replace filter elements
D. Internal System Leakage
Testing: Volumetric efficiency test
- Measure actual vs. theoretical flow
- Should be >90% at operating pressure
- Solution: Identify and repair internal leaks
ISSUE 3: ERRATIC OPERATION
Symptoms: Inconsistent cycle times, jerky motion, pressure spikes
Possible Causes:
A. Air in Hydraulic System
Testing: Observe fluid in reservoir for foaming
- Check for cavitation at pump inlet
- Monitor suction pressure (should be 5-10" Hg vacuum max)
- Solution: Bleed air, check for suction leaks
B. Electrical Control Issues
Testing: Check PLC inputs/outputs
- Verify all sensors are functioning
- Check for loose electrical connections
- Monitor control signal quality with oscilloscope
- Solution: Repair electrical faults, replace faulty sensors
C. Mechanical Binding
Testing: Check ram alignment and guide clearances
- Measure parallelism of ram to bed
- Check for foreign objects in guides
- Verify proper lubrication of wear plates
- Solution: Realign ram, clean guides, replace worn components
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING
ISSUE 4: PLC COMMUNICATION ERRORS
Symptoms: HMI shows communication fault, system won't respond
Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check all communication cables
2. Verify PLC power supply voltages
3. Test network connectivity
4. Review PLC diagnostic LEDs
Solutions:
A. Cable Issues
- Inspect cables for damage or loose connections
- Test cable continuity with multimeter
- Replace damaged cables with shielded types
B. Network Configuration
- Verify IP addresses and subnet masks
- Check for IP conflicts on network
- Reset network settings to factory defaults if needed
C. PLC Hardware Failure
- Replace suspected faulty modules
- Download backup program if available
- Contact controls support: controls@acmemfg.com
ISSUE 5: SAFETY SYSTEM FAULTS
Symptoms: Light curtain errors, emergency stop malfunctions
Safety System Components:
- Safety light curtains (Type 4 devices)
- Emergency stop buttons (Category 1)
- Two-hand control stations
- Safety interlock switches
Diagnostic Procedures:
1. Test each safety device individually
2. Check safety relay module status LEDs
3. Verify proper reset sequence
4. Monitor safety circuit continuity
NEVER bypass safety devices. Contact safety engineer if issues persist.
